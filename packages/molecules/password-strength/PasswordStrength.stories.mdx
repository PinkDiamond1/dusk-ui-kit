# ⚛️ PasswordStrength

PasswordStrengths express what action will occur when a user clicks or touches it.

PasswordStrengths are used to trigger an action, such as _create_, _read_, _update_ or _delete_. Any given page can have up to a **maximum of two** primary password-strengths. Any remaining calls-to-action should be presented as secondary or info variants.

⚠️ Do not use password-strengths as navigational elements, use links when the intention is to take the user to a new page.
