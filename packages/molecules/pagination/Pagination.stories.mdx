# ⚛️ Pagination

An Accordion is a space-saving and attention-focusing component for coupling content with a heading.
Each item in the Accordion is collapsed by default. When one Accordion item is opened, any other open
items are closed. This is what creates the 'accordion' effect.

## Usage

```js
TODO;
```
