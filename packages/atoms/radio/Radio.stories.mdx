# ⚛️ Radio

Radio's checkbox buttons are generally used in radio groups—collections of radio buttons describing a set of related options. Radio buttons are typically rendered as small circles, which are filled or highlighted when selected.

## Variants

Radio buttons come in a variety of flavours that should be utilised according to the following instructions.

| Variant | Usage                      |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| Success | Applies a success styling. |
| Warning | Applies a warning styling. |
| Danger  | Applies a danger styling.  |

## Actions

Only one radio button in a given group can be selected at the same time.

## Usage

```js
<script>
  import Radio from "@dusk-network/radio";
  import { variants } from "@dusk-network/helpers";
