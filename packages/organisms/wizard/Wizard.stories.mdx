# ⚛️ Wizard

An Wizard is a space-saving and attention-focusing component for coupling content with a heading.
Each item in the Wizard is collapsed by default. When one Wizard item is opened, any other open
items are closed. This is what creates the 'wizard' effect.

## Usage

```js
<script>
  import Wizard, { Item } from "@dusk-network/wizard";
</script>


  <Wizard>
    <Item title="Item 1">this is item 1!</Item>
    <Item title="Item 2">this is item 2!</Item>
    <Item title="Item 3">this is item 3!</Item>
  </Wizard>
```
