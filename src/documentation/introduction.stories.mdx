# Dusk UI Kit

## About the UI Kit

The UI Kit is based on Dusk's [media kit](https://dusk.network/pages/media-kit). Dusk launched it's new branding in 2019, with a focus on marketing. Moving into 2020, we will begin to develop an overarching Branding Guidance document which will provide a single source of truth for all of Dusk's communication channels.

Presently, we have built on the existing guidelines, however, we expect to transition to using a typical _Brand Guidance_ approach.

## Purpose

The purpose of the UI Kit is to create a unified toolkit that is used by designers and developers in their projects, ensuring all Dusk projects are accessible and have a consistent look and feel.

**The guidelines contained herein are to be applied to all of Dusk's digital products.**

## Web Toolkit

By bringing design, user experience, accessibility and functionality into reusable components, we can accelerate the speed of development and increase the consistency and reliability of Dusk products.

The components within the UI Kit are organised according to the principles of [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), providing a high level of composition.
